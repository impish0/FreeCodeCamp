 <h2>Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h2>
 <ul class="timeline">
   <li><span class="bold serif">1912</span> - Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1926</span> - Enters Sherborne School, where his passion for mathematics and science becomes evident despite the school's emphasis on classics</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1931</span> - Enrolls at King's College, Cambridge, to study mathematics</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1934</span> - Graduates with first-class honors in mathematics from Cambridge</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1935</span> - Elected a fellow of King's College at age 22 for his work on probability theory</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1936</span> - Publishes "On Computable Numbers," introducing the concept of the Turing machine - a theoretical device that became the foundation of computer science</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1938</span> - Receives his Ph.D. from Princeton University, where he studied under Alonzo Church</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1939</span> - Returns to Cambridge and is recruited by the Government Code and Cypher School at the outbreak of World War II</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1940</span> - Arrives at Bletchley Park, the secret British code-breaking center, where he works on breaking the German Enigma code</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1941</span> - Develops the Bombe machine, which significantly speeds up the decryption of Enigma-encoded messages, potentially shortening the war by 2-4 years</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1942</span> - Travels to the United States to share code-breaking techniques with American cryptographers</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1945</span> - Joins the National Physical Laboratory and begins work on the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1948</span> - Moves to the University of Manchester to work on the Manchester Mark 1 computer</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1950</span> - Publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the famous Turing Test to determine machine intelligence</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1951</span> - Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his contributions to mathematics and computer science</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1952</span> - Prosecuted for homosexuality, which was illegal in Britain at the time. Accepts chemical castration as an alternative to prison</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">1954</span> - Dies at age 41 from cyanide poisoning, ruled suicide by the coroner</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">2009</span> - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issues a public apology for the government's treatment of Turing</li>
   <li><span class="bold serif">2013</span> - Receives a royal pardon from Queen Elizabeth II</li>
